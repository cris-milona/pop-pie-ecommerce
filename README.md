# pop-pie-ecommerce

This web-site was created by Christina Milona and Kostas Christou (https://github.com/26fromthebar) and it is a first attempt to put together part of the knowledge we have acquired on front and back end web-development.

It was built using:

- Node.Js with express server
- MongoDB for the creation of the database
- EJS as a template engine for server side rendering
- JavaScript with Axios library for HTTP requests
- SASS as a CSS preprocessor.

It is an e-commerce multi-page website where the user can navigate to all pages and choose products to add to the cart either as a guest or as an authenticated user. There is also an administrator role that can create, read, update or delete products on the database through an admin panel.

You can find it deployed at https://pop-pie-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/
